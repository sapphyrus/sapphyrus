Hi there, welcome to my profile üëã I'm Phil, 19 years and from Germany. I'm interested in programming, application security, gaming and game hacking. My language of choice is usually Ruby ‚ù§ or Crystal (as you can see from my projects) but I'm also pretty proficient in Lua and ok-ish in JavaScript, Java, C++, C# and PHP.

- You can also reach me via forum DMs but I usually don't check them more than once or twice a day

## ‚ö° Here are some of my current/past projects:

#### Ruby:
- [sapphyrus/vdf](https://github.com/sapphyrus/vdf), a really fast *Valve Data Format* parser / serializer gem for Ruby (Published at [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/vdf))
- [sapphyrus/PwnAdventure3Proxy](https://github.com/sapphyrus/PwnAdventure3Proxy), a [PWN Adventure 3](https://www.pwnadventure.com/) proxy written in Ruby with features such as a pretty clean and modular packet deserializer, basic Aimbot, unlimited Mana and Health and hot reloading of the code.
- [gamesensical/docs](https://github.com/gamesensical/docs), a alternative [lua documentation](https://gamesensical.gitbook.io/docs/) for gamesense. A Ruby tool dynamically generates gitbook, mkdocs and emmylua directories from a few template files and json data
- [sapphyrus/mcd-survey-bot](https://github.com/sapphyrus/mcd-survey-bot), a telegram bot that automatically retrieves the free drink codes from a promotion McDonald's ran in Germany in 2019

#### JavaScript:
- [sapphyrus/nbhourboost](https://github.com/sapphyrus/hsctf-2019), a simple and easy-to-use Steam hourboost tool (don't judge the code too much, I wrote this 3 years ago)
- [gamesensical/gamesensical.github.io](https://github.com/gamesensical/gamesensical.github.io), a js tool that optimizes and beautifies lua code by, for example, localizing global variables (to reduce string table lookups). The code is pretty messy and I'm not a big fan of JS anyway..

#### Lua:
- [sapphyrus/table_gen.lua](https://github.com/sapphyrus/table_gen.lua), a lua library to generate ascii tables inspired by [ozh's Ascii Table Generator website](https://ozh.github.io/ascii-tables/)
- [sapphyrus/sourcenav.lua](https://github.com/sapphyrus/sourcenav.lua), a small and fast Source Engine Navigation Mesh parser
- [sapphyrus/gamesense-lua](https://github.com/sapphyrus/gamesense-lua), some of my pre-workshop lua scripts for gamesense. Some of them are compiled/obfuscated

#### Misc:
- [sapphyrus/hsctf-2019](https://github.com/sapphyrus/hsctf-2019), some writeups for the HSCTF 2019 ctf
- [sapphyrus/CSGO-Grenades](https://github.com/sapphyrus/CSGO-Grenades), a old and outdated list of CS:GO smoke/flash/molly locations for the (back then) active duty maps
